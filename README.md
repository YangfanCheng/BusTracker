#about
BusTracker is a simple web application that allows you search for a specific bus in NJ. The data that I retrieve using a python script is from `http://mybusnow.njtransit.com/bustime/home.jsp`
#components
I used [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) for simple navigation bar and responsiveness, I will add more stuff to it later. I also used [Jquery](http://api.jquery.com/)'s ajax function for asynchronous call, and [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) for javascript.
#Contributers
